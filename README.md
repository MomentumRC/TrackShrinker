Open Source Sensored Brushless Electronic Speed Control for Radio Controlled Car/Truck/Buggy Racing

This project will contain all of the eletronic schematic, layout, gerber, CAD, STL, and C source code files needed to make a working TrackShrinker ESC.

I have a blog set up for the TrackShrinker ESC at http://trackshrinker.com/

There is a good YouTube video of one of the older TrackShrinker ESC prototypes running on a race track.
